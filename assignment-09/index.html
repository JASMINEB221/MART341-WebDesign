                <p>Properly shampooing your hair is easy to do.
                  In order to get the best results from shampooing, you should always
                  use products that are sulfate free, and benefit your hair
                  based on your specific needs. This could mean utilizing shampoos
                  that are structured for moisture, color, volume, etc.
                  After finding the correct shampoo, it is important to know that you
                  can use as much or as little as you would like to gain the desired results.
                  Once you have both the correct shampoo, and the correct amount for your
                  hair, you should massage the shampoo into your scalp, moving down to the
                  bottom of your hair. Massaging the scalp is very important as it opens up
                  your pores and allows your hair to grow and maintain health.
                  After shampooing, you should rinse thoroughly. Make sure all of the product
                  is out before continuing.</p>

  <div><h2>Step 2 - Conditioning Your Hair</h2></div>
        <div style="margin:auto; padding:10px">
            <span style="padding:50px;">
                <p>After you have fully shampooed and rinsed your hair, it is time to use conditioner.
                  Again, use the products and amount necessary for your hair and the desired result.
                  When using conditioner, you should not apply it to your scalp. It should
                  only be used on the bottom of your hair. This will reduce dandruff and grease
                  from your scalp. Leave the conditioner in for 2-5 minutes, and then rinse thoroughly.</p>

        <div style="margin:auto; padding:10px">
            <span style="padding:50px">
                <p>How you dry your hair is very important. Most of the damage caused to your Hair
                  occurs in the drying stage. Things to avoid when drying your hair include:
                  <li>Using Heat</li>
                  <li>Using a Towel</li>
                  <li>Pulling on, or using excess force to dry</li><br>
                  Instead, after rinsing your hair, you should squeeze out the excess water.
                  after getting rid of the excess, you should dry your hair using a t-shirt.
                  A t-shirt is made of softer, less abrasive material, that will dry your
                  hair without causing damage to the roots, or the hair itself.</p>
