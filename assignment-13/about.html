          Jasmine and Justin Brown grew up in Montana. Both being close to family, and knowing the importance of spending
          time together, they wanted to create something that would make it easy for them to spend time together, while
          doing something that they love.

            Candles are a fun and creative way that they could start a business that involved their family. Using organic
            materials, makes it safer and healthier for everyone from the kitchen where the candles are made, to your home.

          Another important aspect is charity. Jasmine and Justin fully understand what it means to not be able to live
          without assistance from family and friends. One thing that you can guarantee is that a percentage of all sales
          go to various different charities, in order to give back to the organizations that gave to them.
