13. The <head> and <body> tags can have many elements within a page. At that point, the number of elements are determined by style, necessary tags for readability and user adaptability.

The head is different than the body because it serves a different purpose.
- The head holds all of the information necessary for the site iteslf o communicate with, such as:
  - any stored languages, i.e. <lang="en US">
  - meta names and descrions of the site
  - title of the site, etc.
-The body holds all of the main pieces of the site, such as:
    - The actual information that the site was created for
    - Images or media that go along with site information
    - Any important links to and fro the site, etc.
14. The difference between structural markup and semantic markup are as follows:

- structural

  structural markup is how the actual web page is set up. This includes layout, and how the actual information is displayed on the screen. This includes tags for lists, paragraphs, headings, etc.

- semantic

  semantic markup is the meaning of the information displayed within the web page itself. This means that different tags are placed within the webpage itself to give meaning to words, add appropriate emphasis, or even describing certain text used (like abbreviations).
15. My work cycle for this week was as follows:

  1. create the appropriate folders/files
  2. copy the template for the index.html file in order to manipulate it
  3. manipulate it, following the directions for homework + directions from the course website.
  4. double check steps as I go in order to make sure that links and other information is being displayed properly on the site. Make any tweaks as necessary.
