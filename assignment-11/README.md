1. A system font is a font that is already on your computer. A web font is a custom font located on a specific server. A web-safe font is a font that can be on any system such as mac or windows.
2. A fallback font is a font choice used, in case a certain font is not available to use on a specific system or browser. It is important to have this, so that the font choice is able to be seen across multiple devices, in case the original doesn't work.
3. The biggest challenge I am facing is that I don't think that I was able to create a viable link for my fonts, so they are not showing correctly.
