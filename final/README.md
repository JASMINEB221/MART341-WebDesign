1. I learned all new things about web development. I did not know anything about code before, or any markdown, or basically anything that involved creating web design before taking this class.
2. I didn't know the difference between html markdown, and css. Before taking this class, I honestly didn't know how webpages were created, how they were stored, or anything of the sort. After taking this class I have learned a lot about what it takes to make a webpage, and it has its easy and hard parts for sure.
3. I had a lot of challenges, mainly with the css portion of the class. It was a lot of user error and trying to figure out how I typed in my tags and divs, and basically starting from scratch. In order to overcome most of my issues, I would copy previous works that I submitted, where it worked, and would restructure it slightly to fit for each assignment. Even in some of those cases, it didn't help. I had to do a lot of re-watching the class videos, using the resources, and trying to make it work.
